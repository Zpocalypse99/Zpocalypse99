Hello! My name is Z Broyles and I am a video game development student currently attending Full Sail University. With a focus on C++ and assembly code, I have worked in multiple groups to create small gaming projects that showcase my game development and design abilities. I also currently work overnight at a hotel and I have a special interest in music and sound design.
